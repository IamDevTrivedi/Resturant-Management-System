# Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

The following non-functional requirements ensure that the system is reliable, secure, maintainable, and scalable while providing a seamless user experience.

---

## 1. Performance Requirements

- The system should handle _at least 1000 concurrent users_ without performance degradation.
- API response time should not exceed _1500ms_ for 95% of requests under normal load.
- The homepage and restaurant discovery pages should load within _2 seconds_ under average network conditions.
- Database queries must be optimized to return results within _500ms_.
- Reservation confirmation and payment processing must complete within _5 seconds_.

---

## 2. Scalability Requirements

- The system should support _horizontal scaling_ to accommodate growing user demand.
- Database design must support _partitioning and sharding_ for large datasets.
- The architecture should allow _adding more servers_ (backend/frontend) without major redesign.
- _Caching (via Redis)_ should be used to handle frequently accessed data (e.g., restaurant list, table availability).
- System components should follow _microservices principles_ for independent scaling.

---

## 3. Security Requirements

- All communication must be encrypted using _HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or higher)_.
- Passwords must be stored securely using _bcrypt hashing with salting_.
- Authentication should use _JWT with refresh tokens_ or _OAuth 2.0_.
- The system should implement _Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)_ to separate customer and restaurant owner permissions.
- Sensitive data (payment details, tokens) should _never be logged_.
- Implement protections against:
  - _SQL Injection_
  - _XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)_
  - _CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)_
  - _Brute-force login attacks_
- Payment gateway integration must comply with _PCI DSS standards_.

---

## 4. Availability & Reliability Requirements

- The system should provide _99.9% uptime_.
- The system must include _auto-restart mechanisms_ for crashed services.
- Database must support _replication and failover_ to ensure continuity.
- Session persistence must be ensured during server restarts.
- Reservation and payment data must not be lost in case of system failure.

---

## 5. Usability Requirements

- The UI should follow _responsive design principles_ to work on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Pages should follow _consistent layout and navigation structure_.
- The system should support _multi-language support_ for a wider user base.
- Error messages should be _clear, actionable, and user-friendly_.
- The booking process should not require more than _5 clicks_.
