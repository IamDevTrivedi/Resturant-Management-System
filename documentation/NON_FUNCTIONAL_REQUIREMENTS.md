# Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

The following non-functional requirements ensure that the system is reliable, secure, maintainable, and scalable while providing a seamless user experience.

---

## 1. Performance Requirements
- The system should handle *at least 1000 concurrent users* without performance degradation.
- API response time should not exceed *1500ms* for 95% of requests under normal load.
- The homepage and restaurant discovery pages should load within *2 seconds* under average network conditions.
- Database queries must be optimized to return results within *500ms*.
- Reservation confirmation and payment processing must complete within *5 seconds*.

---

## 2. Scalability Requirements
- The system should support *horizontal scaling* to accommodate growing user demand.
- Database design must support *partitioning and sharding* for large datasets.
- The architecture should allow *adding more servers* (backend/frontend) without major redesign.
- *Caching (via Redis)* should be used to handle frequently accessed data (e.g., restaurant list, table availability).
- System components should follow *microservices principles* for independent scaling.

---

## 3. Security Requirements
- All communication must be encrypted using *HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or higher)*.
- Passwords must be stored securely using *bcrypt hashing with salting*.
- Authentication should use *JWT with refresh tokens* or *OAuth 2.0*.
- The system should implement *Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)* to separate customer and restaurant owner permissions.
- Sensitive data (payment details, tokens) should *never be logged*.
- Implement protections against:
  - *SQL Injection*
  - *XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)*
  - *CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)*
  - *Brute-force login attacks*
- Payment gateway integration must comply with *PCI DSS standards*.

---

## 4. Availability & Reliability Requirements
- The system should provide *99.9% uptime*.
- The system must include *auto-restart mechanisms* for crashed services.
- Database must support *replication and failover* to ensure continuity.
- Session persistence must be ensured during server restarts.
- Reservation and payment data must not be lost in case of system failure.

---

## 5. Usability Requirements
- The UI should follow *responsive design principles* to work on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Pages should follow *consistent layout and navigation structure*.
- The system should support *multi-language support* for a wider user base.
- Error messages should be *clear, actionable, and user-friendly*.
- The booking process should not require more than *5 clicks*.
