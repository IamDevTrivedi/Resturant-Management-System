# Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

The following non-functional requirements ensure that the system is reliable, secure, maintainable, and scalable while providing a seamless user experience.

---

## 1. Performance Requirements

- The system should handle at least 1000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- API response time should not exceed 1500ms for 95% of requests under normal load.
- The homepage and restaurant discovery pages should load within 2 seconds under average network conditions.
- Database queries must be optimized to return results within 500ms.
- Reservation confirmation and payment processing must complete within 5 seconds.

---

## 2. Scalability Requirements

- The system should support horizontal scaling to accommodate growing user demand.
- Database design must support partitioning and sharding for large datasets.
- The architecture should allow adding more servers (backend/frontend) without major redesign.
- Caching (via Redis) should be used to handle frequently accessed data (e.g., restaurant list, table availability).
- System components should follow microservices principles for independent scaling.

---

## 3. Security Requirements

- All communication must be encrypted using HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or higher).
- Passwords must be stored securely using bcrypt hashing with salting.
- Authentication should use JWT with refresh tokens or OAuth 2.0.
- The system should implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to separate customer and restaurant owner permissions.
- Sensitive data (payment details, tokens) should never be logged.
- Implement protections against:
    - SQL Injection
    - XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
    - CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
    - Brute-force login attacks
- Payment gateway integration must comply with PCI DSS standards.

---

## 4. Availability & Reliability Requirements

- The system should provide 99.9% uptime.
- The system must include auto-restart mechanisms for crashed services.
- Database must support replication and failover to ensure continuity.
- Session persistence must be ensured during server restarts.
- Reservation and payment data must not be lost in case of system failure.

---

## 5. Usability Requirements

- The UI should follow responsive design principles to work on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Pages should follow consistent layout and navigation structure.
- The system should support multi-language support for a wider user base.
- Error messages should be clear, actionable, and user-friendly.
- The booking process should not require more than 5 clicks.

---

## 6. Maintainability Requirements

- The codebase should follow modular design patterns (e.g., MVC or layered architecture).
- The system must provide well-documented APIs using OpenAPI/Swagger.
- Logging and monitoring should be integrated (e.g., using ELK stack or Prometheus + Grafana).
- Developers should follow naming conventions and code style guidelines.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines must be established.

---

## 7. Portability Requirements

- The application should run on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- Mobile app version (if developed) should be cross-platform (Android & iOS).
- Deployment should support cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and on-premise hosting.
- Docker containers should be used to enable environment portability.

---

## 8. Compliance Requirements

- Must comply with GDPR for handling user data.
- Payment integration must comply with PCI DSS.
- Logging and monitoring should comply with local IT regulations.
- Data retention policies must follow legal standards.

---

## 9. Backup & Recovery Requirements

- Automated daily database backups must be maintained.
- Backups should be stored in at least two separate regions.
- The system should allow point-in-time recovery for databases.
- Backup restoration time should not exceed 1 hour.

---

## 10. Monitoring & Auditing Requirements

- All system events (login, reservation, payment, cancellation) must be logged.
- Logs must be tamper-proof and stored securely.
- Monitoring tools must detect abnormal spikes in traffic or failures.
- Audit trails must be available for security and compliance reviews.
